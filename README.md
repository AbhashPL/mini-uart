Uart designed for integration in FPGA designs.

A self-checking testbench is provided which performs basic RX and TX tests for the uart.

Synthesized and tested using Xilinx ISE P.20131013.

Tested on:
- xc6slx9 (Xilinx Spartan 6) FPGA on the MimasV2 board.

Next Steps:
- [ ] FIFOs + Handling backpressure.
- [ ] AXI/AXI-L based interface.
